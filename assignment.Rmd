Display all of your answers by simply writing the variable name at the end of the code block.

Load libraries that you need
```{r setup, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library('RSQLite')
library("DBI")
```

Connect to `chinook.db`
```{r}
# 
```


Create variables to represent the tables: `genres, albums, artists, tracks, invoices, customers, media_types`. This will make it easier to use these tables later on.
```{r}
#
```


Who are the first 10 `customers` in the database? Return only `FirstName` and `LastName`
Answer using SQL and `dbGetQuery()` (not `tbl()`)
```{r}
#
```


Complete the same task as above using `tbl()`
```{r}
#
```


For the rest of the assignment, please use the `tbl()` function ... but you may use raw SQL if it is easier for you.

Count the number of `customers` by `country` and arrange in descending order.
```{r}
#
```


Plot the sum of `Total` from invoices by year in a line chart.
```{r}
#
```


What's the average length of a `track` for each `artist` on each `album`?
```{r}
#
```



If the different `media_types` cost different amounts of money to sell, calculate your top 10 most profitable tracks. For this example, all costs are equal EXCEPT for the `media_type`.  

COSTS:  

  - MPEG = $0.15
  - Protected MPEG-4 = $0.25
  - AAC = $0.03
  - Protected AAC = $0.10
  - Purchased AAC = $0.08
  
```{r}
#
```


Use `tidyr` functions `spread()` or `gather()` to show data that counts the number of `artists` by `genre` looks like the following:
```{r}
# A tibble: 1 x 26
#   Alternative `Alternative & … Blues `Bossa Nova` Classical Comedy Drama `Easy Listening`
#         <int>            <int> <int>        <int>     <int>  <int> <int>            <int>
#          40              332    81           15        74     17    64               24
# … with 18 more variables: `Electronica/Dance` <int>, `Heavy Metal` <int>, `Hip Hop/Rap` <int>,
#   Jazz <int>, Latin <int>, Metal <int>, Opera <int>, Pop <int>, `R&B/Soul` <int>, Reggae <int>,
#   Rock <int>, `Rock And Roll` <int>, `Sci Fi & Fantasy` <int>, `Science Fiction` <int>,
#   Soundtrack <int>, `TV Shows` <int>, World <int>, `<NA>` <int>
  
```



Create a Scatter Plot of `tracks`, x = milliseconds and y = bytes 
```{r}

```


Create a Scatter Plot of `tracks`, x = milliseconds and y = bytes, `facet_wrap` by `media_type`
```{r}

```


Create a linear regression model using `milliseconds` as a predictor of `bytes`. Hint, formula: `bytes ~ milliseconds`
```{r}

```


Create a linear model using the same formula but split it out according to `media_type`
```{r}

```
